ABSTRACT = {The Leap Motion Controller is a new device for hand gesture controlled user interfaces with declared sub-millimeter accuracy. However, up to this point its capabilities in real environments have not been analyzed. Therefore, this paper presents a first study of a Leap Motion Controller. The main focus of attention is on the evaluation of the accuracy and repeatability. For an appropriate evaluation, a novel experimental setup was developed making use of an industrial robot with a reference pen allowing a position accuracy of 0.2 mm. Thereby, a deviation between a desired 3D position and the average measured positions below 0.2mmhas been obtained for static setups and of 1.2mmfor dynamic setups. Using the conclusion of this analysis can improve the development of applications for the Leap Motion controller in the field of Human-Computer Interaction.},

@article{Hajas2020,
abstract = {An important challenge that affects ultrasonic mid-air haptics, in contrast to physical touch, is that we lose certain exploratory procedures such as contour following. This makes the task of perceiving geometric properties and shape identification more difficult. Meanwhile, the growing interest in mid-air haptics and their application to various new areas requires an improved understanding of how we perceive specific haptic stimuli, such as icons and control dials in mid-air. We address this challenge by investigating static and dynamic methods of displaying 2D geometric shapes in mid-air. We display a circle, a square, and a triangle, in either a static or dynamic condition, using ultrasonic mid-air haptics. In the static condition, the shapes are presented as a full outline in mid-air, while in the dynamic condition, a tactile pointer is moved around the perimeter of the shapes. We measure participants' accuracy and confidence of identifying shapes in two controlled experiments (n_1 = 34, n_2 = 25). Results reveal that in the dynamic condition people recognise shapes significantly more accurately, and with higher confidence. We also find that representing polygons as a set of individually drawn haptic strokes, with a short pause at the corners, drastically enhances shape recognition accuracy. Our research supports the design of mid-air haptic user interfaces in application scenarios such as in-car interactions or assistive technology in education.},

@article{Frier2018,
	abstract = {One way to create mid-air haptics is to use an ultrasonic phased-array, whose elements may be controlled to focus acoustic pressure to points in space (referred to as focal points). At these focal points the pressure can then deflect off the skin and induce a tactile sensation. Furthermore, by rapidly and repeatedly updating the position of a focal point over a given trajectory, ultrasound phased-array can draw two dimensional curves (referred to as patterns) on a users' palms. While producing these patterns, there are three major parameters at play: the rate at which the pattern is repeated, the pattern length, and the focal point speed. Due to the interdependence between these parameters, only the repetition rate (frequency) or the speed can be set for a tactile pattern of a given length. In the current study, we investigate which approach (frequency or speed) is most effective at maximising the tactile sensation. We first carried out a vibrometry study to show that optimising the speed can maximise the skin deflection caused by a focal point following circular patterns. A further user study was undertaken to show that optimising the speed consequently maximises the perceived intensity of the tactile pattern. In both studies, the optimal speed result is shown to be equivalent to the speed at which surface waves propagate from the skin deflection effected by the focal point. Overall, our investigations highlight the importance of the speed of stimulation movement in the design of tactile patterns.},
