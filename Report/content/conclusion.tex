\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
After finishing the project and observing multiple shapes using different types of 
rendering methods like AM and TPS, we collectively came to a conclusion that basic primitive geometric
shapes(square, circle triangle, etc) are better recognized in Amplitude Modulation. 
Pointer movement on hand gesture using ultra leap, the feature that we call "Leap Live" 
showed the best results in recognition of movement and directions. \\[2mm]
We also wrote a test script to slow down the pointer movements on the corners of a square and triangle, 
and concluded that corners if rendered with slow pointer movement are recognized a bit easier. The final 
conclusion was that for Ultraviz and oil bath experiment TPS looks better visually. 
However, for hand sensation AM feels better if rendering with varying capacities and methods.
