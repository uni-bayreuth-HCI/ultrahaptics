Over the years of evolution of human computer interaction, we have seen various kinds of interaction techniques. The recent trend of contactless haptic technology has been on the rise. In our project we focus to render custom shapes on the user palm, using different kinds of rendering techniques. The main objective of our project is to map various kinds of user input like CSV, SVG, drawing from canvas and inputs from leap motion. We try to accept these kind of inputs and process them in order to render custom shapes. Also, we try to analyse and compare the different techniques of rendering with validation techniques and deduce results from the study.
