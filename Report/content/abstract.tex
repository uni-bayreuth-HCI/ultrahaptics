Over the years of evolution of human computer interaction, we have seen various kinds of interaction techniques. The recent trend of contactless haptic technology has been on the rise. In our project we focus to render custom shapes on the user palm, using different kinds of rendering techniques. The main objective of this project is to map various kinds of user input like CSV, SVG, drawing from canvas and inputs from leap motion. We consume these inputs and process them in order to render custom shapes. Also, this report analyse and compare the different techniques of rendering with various validation techniques and deduce an overall result from the study and implementation of the proposed application.
