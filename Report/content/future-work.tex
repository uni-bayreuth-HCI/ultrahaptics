\chapter{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}
The future work relating to this project would be to implement a new method of 
rendering where the system automatically recognizes the curves, corners, 
edges from the varying range of dynamic input and render the corners, edges 
and curves with varying intensity and speed dynamically. Also if the input 
is a disjoint figure, like the wifi logo as shown in fig. 5.3(b) and 5.3(b) it is 
better to create different control point for different disjoint lines/curves.\\
To include DTP method mentioned by Hajas in \cite{Hajas2020} for dynamic shapes.
